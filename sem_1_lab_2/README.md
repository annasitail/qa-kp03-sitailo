The second assignment is based on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QtzuIKQLm5YrSG8txEga43X_fHGs-UR89_9YroK4psA/

So, in order to be able work on the second assignment you need to have the final working version of the first assignment.

In terms of the current assignment you need to develop the HTTP (Restful) application that will allow you to run absolutely the same commands like in the previous assignment using HTTP protocol.

The next resources should be defined:

/directory
/binaryfile
/logtextfile
/bufferfile

In order to map the operations specified in the first assignment the next graph can be used:

IMPORTANT:
The assignment should be done step by step:
Create a prototype of the system (this is just signatures of functions without implementation. It is not possible to create tests if you donâ€™t do this step. But this is not full implementation)
Create Tests (PyTest or Robot)
Provide implementation
Bugfixes

So, there should be at least 4 commits.
